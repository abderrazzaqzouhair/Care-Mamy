    <string name="about_intro">
        Following are the most common mistakes that you must avoid during your period:\n
        Do not eat foods that contain a lot of salts: When you are having a period, excess intake of salts causes pain in your abdomen and a lack of water in your body. So if you want to avoid this issue, you should stop eating foods that contain a lot of salt just before one week your period starts.\n
        Stop drinking too much coffee: Coffee contains too much caffeine that is very harmful during a period. You should take only one cup of coffee each day during the period. Taking in a lot of caffeine causes belly pain and other such discomforts.

        Avoid smoking:\n
